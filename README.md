# 🚌 Bus Transportation Utilization Dashboard

This project presents a comprehensive **Excel-based interactive dashboard** designed to analyze public bus transportation usage. The dashboard tracks total passenger volume, trip patterns, route efficiency, and bus utilization across time, helping identify underperforming time slots and optimize transit operations.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Urban transit authorities often face challenges like:
- Uneven passenger distribution throughout the day
- Under or over-utilized buses
- Lack of clear visibility on route-wise and time-wise demand
- Ineffective use of operational data for planning

These issues result in increased operational costs, passenger inconvenience, and inefficient resource allocation.

---

## ✅ Solution

To address these challenges, I developed an **interactive dashboard** using Microsoft Excel that:
- Analyzes passenger trends across time slots, weekdays, and routes
- Identifies peak and off-peak hours
- Categorizes buses as **under-utilized**, **well-utilized**, or **over-utilized**
- Provides insights to support better scheduling and planning decisions

## 📈 Conclusion

This dashboard provides a clear and insightful view into bus transit performance by answering key operational questions:
- **When are the buses most/least used?**
- **Which routes need optimization?**
- **Which buses are not being used efficiently?**

With these insights, transport authorities and analysts can:
- Re-assign buses based on demand
- Adjust schedules for peak and off-peak hours
- Increase rider satisfaction while reducing costs
